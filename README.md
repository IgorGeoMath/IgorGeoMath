### Hi there, I'm Igor 👋
#### 📐 Aspiring Mathematical Physicist | 🐍 Computational Geometry Enthusiast

I am an undergraduate student transitioning from a technical background in **Cyber Defense** towards a career in **Pure Mathematics** and **Theoretical Physics**.

While my formal training in IT provides me with strong algorithmic logic and security principles, my true focus lies in understanding the geometric structures of the universe.

---

### 🔭 The Research Goal
My academic roadmap is directed towards the **Master's Program at UFSC (PPGMTM)**, with a specific interest in:
* **Geometry & Topology** (Lorentzian Geometry).
* **General Relativity** and Spacetime Singularities.
* **Mathematical Physics.**

---

### 🧬 Methodology: Tech as a Tool
I view my background in IT not as an end in itself, but as a powerful instrument to visualize and solve mathematical problems.

* **The Background:** Finishing a degree in Cyber Defense (2026).
* **The Application:** Using Python (`NumPy`, `SciPy`) to model linear transformations, visualize tensors, and simulate physical systems.
* **The Mindset:** Applying the rigorous logic of cryptography to mathematical proofs.

---

### 🛠️ Toolbox

* **Core Focus:** Linear Algebra, Real Analysis, Differential Geometry.
* **Languages:** Python (Scientific Stack), LaTeX (Academic Writing).
* **Environment:** Linux / Bash.

---

### 📚 Current Studies (Self-Taught & Academic)

* **Linear Algebra:** Exploring vector spaces and spectral theorems (Hoffman & Kunze).
* **Real Analysis:** Building rigorous foundations (Elon Lages Lima).
* **Computational Math:** Visualizing geometric transformations using code.
